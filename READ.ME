 a component of an engineering project, you have been tasked with acquiring inclination angle measurementdata  (0-90 degree)
   This  data  will  be  used  as  a  parameter  for  numerous  custom  algorithms,  thus  it  is  your responsibility  to  develop  an  ESDX  embedded  prototype  to  acquire  the  angle  data,  
   process  the  data, and transmit the data for display and recording

The requirement is to set ATD4 and Busclock as 8MHz.
